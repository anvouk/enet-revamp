# ENET - revamped

A cleaned-up version of enet + some features and better documentation.

This fork of enet tries to be as API compatible with the original as possible.

Changes so far:
- Repo cleaned-up
- `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` integration and code reformatted
- Drop autotools support in favor of full cmake
